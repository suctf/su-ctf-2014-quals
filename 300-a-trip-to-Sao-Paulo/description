That was strange! I was on a trip to Sao Paulo, I think it was March 14 or 15. I was browsing the web, and then all of a sudden My DNS lookups get weird and I start getting certificate errors, and then after a while, things were back to normal. I should add I was using 8.8.8.8

FLAG="event_start_time:event_end_time" time is of format HH:mm:ss
